NeuralNetwork_tensorflowModel
In this jupyter notebook, a Neural network is designed to predict some values from dataset.
Let's learn about the dataset:
The dataset comprises of data of some interactions of clients with an agency and to which we are supposed to predict if the client actually purchase the product or not.
The interactions are in form of Number of call, emails, webpage visits, etc.

First job at hand would be to clean this dataset, because its going to main irrelevant data, NaN values, and string values as well.
So we'll be converting and categorizing this data as well to make it usable to our training.
